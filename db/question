Use the above environment to demonstrate your
grasp of fragmentation and reconstruction. Think of a domain area comprising of
at least four distributed relations.
Write out your applications/reports and
use them to perform fragmentation.

Come up with appropriate query access frequencies of your choice.

Allocate the fragments by implementing them physically in the participating databases.

Choose one of the sites to be the decision site and perform reconstruction using either views, functions, stored
procedures or any other technique.
